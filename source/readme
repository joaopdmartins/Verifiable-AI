Hey!

You can find all the code here.
For a quick glance of Spin works:

cd examples-for-explaining-approach
./run.bash

This will trigger a verification with an intended error and will ask Spin to emit the counterexample that violated the specification.

You can then explore the other directories, where you have the different phases of the approach.

Good luck :D
